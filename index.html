<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
English engineer and computer scientist Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee
invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in
1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was
released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age, and is the primary means for billions of people to interact via the Internet.</p>
